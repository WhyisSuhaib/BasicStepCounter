# BasicStepCounter
This app uses the accelerometer sensor ti count steps. The algorithm used in the app takes the magnitude of the acceleration along the 3 axis. Then it calculates the difference of the acceleration magnitude from the previous values. If this value is greater a certain threshold (For walking greater than 6 and for running greater than 10) then it does the counting accordingly. The data is saved in the Shared Preference of the App during onPause and onStop method. Using onResume method, the data is retrieved back for the subsequent use.
